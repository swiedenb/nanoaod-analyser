# NanoAOD Analyser

This is an approach to analyse NanoAOD with RDataframe

The analysis code for the three different LFV channels can be found in their specific branch (EMuLFV, ETauLFV, MuTauLFV).
The main analysis of this author was the MuTauLFV while the other two channels are created for completeness and might contain outdated values at the time of finishing the studies of the MuTau channel.
